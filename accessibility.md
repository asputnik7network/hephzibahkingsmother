# Accessibility Statement

We are committed to ensuring digital accessibility for people with disabilities. We are continually improving the user experience for everyone and applying relevant accessibility standards.

Last updated: 2026-01-15

Conformance

- We aim to conform to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA. Where full conformance is not yet achieved, we describe known limitations below and prioritize fixes.

Measures to support accessibility

- Semantic, accessible HTML structure and ARIA roles where necessary.
- Keyboard navigable interface and logical focus order.
- Sufficient color contrast for text and interactive elements.
- Responsive, mobile-friendly layout and scalable text.
- Alt text for meaningful images and captions/transcripts for multimedia where available.
- Automated accessibility checks (e.g., axe, Lighthouse) and manual testing with assistive technologies.
- Ongoing developer training and accessibility reviews as part of our workflow.

Known limitations and solutions

- Some third-party content or embedded widgets may not meet our accessibility standards. We are working with vendors or replacing components where possible.
- Older PDFs or documents may not be fully accessible. We will provide accessible alternatives on request.
- Certain interactive visualizations or features might require further improvements to be fully accessible.
