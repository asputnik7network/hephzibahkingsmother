# Fingerprinting & Data Handling Disclosure

**Effective Date:** January 15, 2026

This disclosure explains how Hephzibah King's Mother collects, transmits, and handles fingerprint and biometric data for Level 2 background screening services.

## Our Authorization

Hephzibah King's Mother is an approved LiveScan service provider authorized by:
- **Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE)**
- **Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)**

We are authorized to collect electronic fingerprints for Level 2 background screenings required by Florida law for individuals working with children, the elderly, or vulnerable adults.

## What is Level 2 Screening?

A Level 2 background screening is a comprehensive state and national criminal history check that includes:
- Fingerprint-based search of Florida criminal records (via FDLE)
- Fingerprint-based search of national criminal records (via FBI)
- Search of the National Sex Offender Registry
- Employment history verification (when required)
- Reference checks (when required)

Level 2 screenings are mandated by Florida Statutes Chapter 435 for positions of trust and responsibility.

## Fingerprint Collection Process

### In-Person Only
**Important:** Fingerprints are collected ONLY in person at our authorized location. No biometric or fingerprint data is collected through our website or any online system.

### LiveScan Technology
We use electronic LiveScan fingerprinting equipment that:
